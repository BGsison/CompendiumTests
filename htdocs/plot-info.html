The beast turns out to be a lost human girl, Anne Boonchuy, who was running away from a giant red mantis. The girl saves Sprig from the monstrous insect and he calls her a hero. A few minutes later a mob led by the Mayor captures Anne. The mantis catches up to them and the mob runs away leaving Anne and Sprig to the job. Working together, they successfully beat the mantis, although the mob starts to seize Anne again. Sprig takes responsibility for her and she stays with the Plantars for the time being. Once the Plantars were out of the basement (which is where she is staying), Anne reveals an antique music box and tries to make it work. She unfortunately fails, but so marks the beginning of her adventures in the “frog world”, Amphibia.</p>

Bessie breaks down and a storm is moving in, so they stop and stay at Dandy Lion Inn for the meantime. The inn is a bed and breakfast, owned by a couple of friendly horned-bullfrogs, Teddy and Martha. While the older Plantar kids have their own rooms, Polly stays with Hop Pop and this bothers her. She then gets the room next to Hop Pop's, and although she is happy at first  for the feeling of independence, she starts to get scared. She goes to Anne and Sprig’s rooms, and then back to Hop Pop’s, but finds that they have all disappeared. She then gets attacked by Martha, but she is able to escape through the laundry shoot. Polly then discovers that the bullfrogs of the inn are cannibals, ready to eat her family. She comes to the rescue and defeats the bullfrogs, escaping with her family, Bessie, and all the other snails owned by past guests. Anne destroys the inn with chemistry, finding giant barrels of baking powder and vinegar within her reach. They all end up sleeping in Hop Pop's bed.</p>

She tells the family about this, but they don’t believe her. To prove the fact that she isn’t going insane, she goes to Wally, who claims he had seen it too, and asks him for help to find the Moss Man. On the quest, Wally saves her and they both see each other as friends, although Anne gets frustrated when they find it and Wally admits he hasn’t seen it up until that point. Anne doesn’t want to be like Wally. Wally gets hurt by this remark, so she apologizes. They both see the Moss man on top of a cliff, but as Anne was about to climb and take a picture of it, Wally falls off and Anne gets up to save him, missing the opportunity to take the photo. They go to town telling everyone about it, but without any evidence of the Moss Man’s existence, the town doesn't believe them. By then, though, they thought that it was okay, because they knew what they saw and what the town thought of them wasn’t important anymore.</p>

He tries different ways of getting rid of her, but each just makes Sylvia look better to Hop Pop. Seeing that Sprig is upset, Sylvia tries to talk to him about it, but Sprig sees a small island with blue flowers on it and lies to her about them being Hop Pop's favorite so that she would swim to it. Hop Pop then comes out ready to fish after Sylvia told him that he should spend more time with Sprig, causing Sprig to feel guilty about everything he did to get rid of Sylvia.

He doubts it will work, although when the kids accidentally break the ship again he decides to apply it on them one night just to see its effects.

Before going to bed, the effects wore off and the kids started roughhousing again, forcing Hop Pop to apply a second dose. A few minutes later, they start turning into mind-controlled zombies, Hop Pop runs into Gary who turns out to be a sentient mushroom who is planning to take over Amphibia.

Toadstool is pissed by this and bets that the Frog of the Year celebration party, traditionally held by the owner of the title, is going to be a disaster. To prove the Mayor wrong, Anne plans the party with Hop Pop being in charge of the entertainment as the “Master of Ceremonies”, Polly administering exclusivity as the party’s bouncer, and Sprig bearing the spectacle with a confession to Ivy. Anne later becomes obsessed with proving the Mayor wrong. The party starts out as expected, everything is going exceptionally well until the giant “sashimi” mudskipper starts causing chaos and the three key parts of the party start falling apart. The wooden statue catches fire and everyone starts to panic. Anne tames the mudskipper and rescues the townspeople with the help of the Mayor, putting the fire out in the process using the chocolate fountain. Hop Pop tells Anne that they voted for her not because she was flawless but because she has grown so much in her time there. Toadstool admits that even he is impressed and that Anne deserves the award. Later, as the party resumes, Ivy ends up asking Sprig if he wants to go out with her and he accepts. Just a few moments after the couple left to dance, Toadie approaches Anne and tells her a “friend” is waiting for her at the bridge just outside of town.

                <p class="content indent"><b>Reunion.</b> In a flashback to three months ago, the duo skip class together to celebrate Anne’s birthday. Just as Anne was about to go home for the party her parents are throwing, Marcy texts saying she found the perfect gift for Anne downtown. Anne is threatened by Sasha to stay with her instead, and the duo goes to meet their other friend. In the present, the toads enter Wartwood to invite everyone to a banquet to celebrate the reunion. After Anne gives her okay for the town, they all head to Toad Tower. While the frogs are enjoying themselves at the banquet, the girls hang out in Sasha’s room. Sprig doubts this is an honest celebration, and his suspicions are proven right after he talks to a nervous toad guard. He announces that they are being held prisoners and the townspeople start to fight back. Back in Sasha’s room, Anne asks about the rebellion Sasha has mentioned and she explains that Hop Pop has been sparking revolutions across the valley and that the toads plan to feed him to a giant venus fly trap. The banquet was Sasha’s plan to lure the frogs, especially Hop Pop, to the tower. Anne tries to rescue everyone and suggests escaping through the sewer, but they all end up getting caught and recaptured. As Hop Pop is about to be executed, Anne defends him and stands up against Sasha with the help of her best friend Sprig. Grime suggests the girls fight a duel: if Anne wins, the prisoners are to be released and sent home without being hurt; but if Sasha does, the original plan is to be followed. Anne ends up defeating Sasha, but Grime is still insistent on killing Hop Pop so he captures him. However, the boomshrooms planted by Wally in the sewer started to explode one by one, and the tower starts to crumble. While everyone runs for their lives, the stone under Sasha collapses and Anne tries to save her. She, even with the Plantar’s help, is unable to due to their combined weights, and the bricks holding their footing are starting to break and crack. Sasha thinks Anne would be better off without her, so she lets go. Grime is able to catch her unconscious body, and he and the remains of his toad army walk away into the night. After getting back to Wartwood, the Plantars feel sorry for Anne and apologize that she lost Sasha as a friend. Anne tells them it’s okay because she and the Plantars are family and as long as they are together, they are going to be alright.</p>
